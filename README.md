# Antares snippets

In case you don't know, [Antares](https://www.cerfacs.fr/antares) is an awesome post-processing library and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is an awesome text editor.
As most of the time you end up writing scripts, I wrote some snippets to accelerate the process of writing an Antares script.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Sublime Text 2](https://www.sublimetext.com) installed on your machine.

### Installing

1. open Sublime Text
2. open the Command Palette (Tools -> Command Palette)
3. go to the Browse Packages folder
4. make a symbolic link of Antares_snippets into this folder
